# Storyblok quick starter project

Welcome to this sample project for Remix!
This project serves as a quick starter for integrating Storyblok, a headless CMS, into your web development projects.

For starting, you can access to the `my-remix-app` folder.
In the folder you have some files like:

- `app/root.tsx`: the configuration with Storyblok API;
- `app/routes/$.jsx`: the initialization of the Storyblok Bridge.
